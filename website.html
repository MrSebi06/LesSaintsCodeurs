			<h1>9 Ways To Improve Bad Website Design</h1>
			<h4>By Ayat Shukairy</h4>
		</div>

		<section id="intro">
			<br>
			<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p>Your website reads well and you’re proud of it. But, you’ve tried and tried to create something that <strong>looks good</strong> too, and you can’t seem to get it together. You’re waiting for rave reviews but none have come your way. Your website is a <strong>flop</strong>. Not to worry. You’re not alone. You want to <strong>fix it</strong> but you don’t have the big <strong>budget</strong> you need to hire a great web developer. Check out some simple ways you can <strong>improve your website</strong> and get it into <strong>better</strong> shape, now!</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part1">
			<br>
			<h2>1. Balance your page</h2>
			<div id="flex1">
			<p class="p1">When users enter a website, their focus first starts at the <strong>top left</strong> of the page, and hovers there before slowly tracking to the <strong>right</strong>. Contrary to what many think, the web user is focused more on the <strong>text</strong> of the page, rather than images or graphics. This is where <strong>balance</strong> comes into place.</p>

			</figure>
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Balance will not only make your page more <strong>visually appealing</strong>, but it will make your page <strong>easier to read</strong> and items <strong>easier to find</strong>. A good layout will help the objects on your page to flow.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part2">
			<br>
			<h2>2. Keep it simple</h2>
			<p><strong>Less</strong> is <strong>more</strong>. Clean your website up by removing all the <strong>unnecessary</strong> visual elements. This will allow important items to stand out.<br><br>Leave some <strong>white space</strong> on the page.<br><br>The allusion of space is visually pleasing, as well as <strong>easier to navigate</strong>. Otherwise, your visitor will get whiplash by darting their head from left to right in an attempt to look at all the <strong>information</strong> crammed on your screen. Or worse, they’ll click on out of there in a hurry.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part3">
			<br>
			<h2>3. Fix your fonts</h2>
			<p>The <strong>size and type</strong> of font you select will have an effect on how your reader takes in your information. What font should you use? <strong>Sans-serif</strong> fonts such as <span id="arial">Arial</span> and <span id="verdana">Verdana</span> are popular choices for on-screen reading. And keep the <span id="size">size</span> in mind too. The font size should be <strong>no smaller than <span id="ten">10 points</span></strong> and <strong>no larger than <span id="twentyfour">24 points</span></strong>. You don’t want the reader to be able to read the information from <strong>across the room</strong>, but you don’t want them <strong>squinting and leaning</strong> closer to the monitor either.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part4">
			<br>
			<h2>4. Clean backgrounds</h2>
			<p><strong>Go subtle</strong>. The background textures and colors you choose can gauge the overall <strong>appeal</strong> of the website. <span id="texture">Lots of texture and graphics in the background can be <strong>distracting</strong></span>, and the more texture you add to the background, the <strong>less noticeable</strong> your text and images become. If you’re going to use a color on the background, make sure there is a significant <strong>contrast</strong> between the background color and the text. Make good choices. You will rarely go wrong with <span id="blackonwhite">black text on a white background</span>. It’s crisp, clean, and easy to read. Be <strong>cautious</strong> when using darker and brighter colors such as <span id="red">red</span> or <span id="yellow">yellow</span>. <span id="fadeyellow">They cause visual <strong>fatigue</strong> and the reader will lose their focus on the text.</p>

			<br>
			<h2>5. Graphics</h2>
			<p>Graphics are often <strong>overused</strong> on webpages. We often <strong>clutter</strong> the pages with objects that look cool but serve <strong>no purpose</strong> other than to increase the download time. Here are some instances where you can use graphics to enhance your pages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span id="flex1"><strong>Logo</strong> <img src="images/LOGO.svg" height="22px"> – Your logo is your brand recognition and it adds visual appeal to your webpages.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Title bars</strong> – The title bar lets your visitors know which page they are on. </li>
				<li><strong>Horizontal rules</strong> – Graphic lines are often used to separate categories or sections of a webpage. </li>
				<li><strong>Background images</strong> – Are used to add visual appeal or make a web site easier to navigate.</li>
				<li><strong>Photos</strong> – Personalize a website and make it inviting. </li>
				<li><strong>Navigation icons</strong>, such as ‘home’ and ‘back’ enhance a page because they are familiar and users anticipate seeing them.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="part6">
			<br>
			<h2>6. Easy navigation</h2>
			<p>Create a toolbar with links that are <strong>easy to navigate</strong>. Position the toolbar in an area that <strong>makes sense</strong>. Web users often look for the toolbar across the <strong>top</strong> or <strong>down</strong> the <strong>left</strong> hand side of the page. Going with the norm will create a sense of <strong>familiarity</strong> and facilitate the ease of navigation. And don’t forget a link to your <strong>homepage</strong>. It’s often forgotten but very important to point your users to your home page. Check out <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/" target="_blank">www.invespcro.com</a> for an example of easy and <strong>well structured</strong> website navigation.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part7">
			<br>
			<h2>7. Text readability</h2>
			<p>You have great copy, but are you displaying it <strong>effectively</strong>? Make your pages <strong>easy to read</strong>. Break up blocks of text and create <strong>short paragraphs</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consider the key points on each page and create <strong>headings</strong> and <strong>subheadings</strong>.</li>
				<li>Only use <strong>one or two fonts</strong>. Select one font for your headings and subheadings and another for the body text.</li>
				<li>Highlight key words and phrases by <strong>bolding</strong> or using a <strong>different color</strong>. Be careful when selecting colors, and don’t use every color in the rainbow. Many such as yellow and pink don’t stand out well if you’ve selected a white or black background.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="part8">
			<br>
			<h2>8. Scrolling</h2>
			<p><div id="scroll"><NOBR>Horizontal scrolling? Yikes. That needs to go, now! Users <em>hate</em>, <strong><em>hate</em></strong>, <strong>hate</strong> to scroll left to right. It’s <strong>disorienting</strong> and <strong>annoying</strong>, so if you’ve got it, lose it.</NOBR></div></p>

			<p>Vertical scrolling is ok if you have to have it, but consider moving <strong>larger blocks of information</strong> to <strong>another page</strong> and providing links. There’s also the danger of missing vital information that falls <strong>below the screen</strong> if a user decides not to scroll down to view it. So if you’ve got to have a scrolling page, try to keep all your <strong>important information above</strong> the fold.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="part9">
			<br>
			<h2>9. Make it quick</h2>
			<p>We all get <strong>impatient</strong> when it takes <strong>more than 5 seconds</strong> to connect to a website. Users want to make contact, and make it <strong>quick</strong>. Ensure that your pages load as quickly as possible. Eliminate <strong>unnecessary graphics</strong>, especially flash graphics… they can be time hogs. You need to make an <strong>immediate impression</strong>, and the only impression you’re leaving as your page slowly grinds in to view is “this page sucks”….if they’re still there to see it at all.</p>
